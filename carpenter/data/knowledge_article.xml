<h2>How Projects and Tasks Are Automatically Managed for Your Products in Odoo 📊🛠️</h2> <p>In Odoo, certain service products are designed to trigger automatic project or task management workflows upon sale. This can be incredibly useful for managing time-tracked services like carpentry work, custom-built furniture, or consultancy tasks.</p> <h3>What Happens When You Sell These Products? 🔧</h3> <p>When a product is sold, Odoo can automatically create a project or assign tasks to a global project. Here’s what each product does:</p> <h3>1. Wood Frame and Custom Table – Projects Based on Templates 📋</h3> <p>These products are linked to a specific project template. When sold, Odoo will:</p> <ul> <li>Automatically create a new project.</li> <li>The new project will be based on the predefined project template, ensuring consistency in tasks and project structure.</li> <li>You can track time through timesheets and invoice the client based on project completion or milestones.</li> </ul> <h3>2. Custom Desk – Tasks in a Global Project 🗂️</h3> <p>Unlike the Wood Frame and Custom Table, the Custom Desk creates tasks within a pre-existing global project. Here’s how it works:</p> <ul> <li>When sold, Odoo will create a new task inside the designated global project.</li> <li>This task can be tracked through timesheets, allowing you to bill the client for the time spent on each individual task.</li> <li>Invoicing is done based on delivery, meaning you charge when the task or service is completed.</li> </ul> <h3>How to Use This in Your Business 🚀</h3> <p>By selling these services, you’re not just creating revenue but also organizing your work. Odoo handles the back-end project creation and task assignment, saving you time and ensuring each service is tracked effectively.</p> <h3>Benefits of This Setup 💡</h3> <ul> <li><strong>Automation:</strong> Automatically create projects or tasks when products are sold.</li> <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> Use templates to ensure your projects follow a standardized structure.</li> <li><strong>Time Tracking:</strong> Easily track the time spent on each project or task through timesheets.</li> <li><strong>Seamless Invoicing:</strong> Bill your clients based on delivery or time spent.</li> </ul> <h3>Wrap-Up 🎉</h3> <p>Odoo’s project and task tracking integration with products allow you to streamline your service-based sales. Whether you're building custom furniture or offering consultancy services, these features ensure efficient project management from the moment a sale is made!</p>

<h2>Quotation Template Magic: Simplified Roof Project Estimation 🏠✨</h2> <p>Odoo takes the hassle out of creating quotations for complex projects, like roofing, by allowing you to customize and calculate material needs directly from a quotation template. Here's how you can make the most of it:</p> <h3>1. Automatic Calculations Based on Roof Size 📐🔨</h3> <p>In the quotation template, you can set up a dynamic system where the customer’s roof size determines the amount of materials needed. The template calculates:</p> <ul> <li>The exact quantity of materials required based on roof dimensions (tiles, beams, insulation, etc.).</li> <li>You can also input your desired margin on these materials directly within the quotation, ensuring that your costs are covered and profits are built in automatically.</li> <li>This flexibility allows you to create as many variations or amounts as needed for different customers and roof sizes.</li> </ul> <h3>2. Simplified Quotations – Hide Detailed Lines 📝👀</h3> <p>If you want to present a cleaner, more summarized quotation to your customers, Odoo has the perfect solution. By clicking on <strong>Simplified Quotation</strong> in the quotation template, you can:</p> <ul> <li>Hide all the sales order (SO) lines for a more streamlined look.</li> <li>If sections are included, they will summarize the hidden SO lines under each section for clarity.</li> <li>If no SO lines are present, the section will default to displaying the project name specified for the quotation, giving your customer a clear overview.</li> </ul> <h3>Why Use These Features? 🌟</h3> <ul> <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Automatic material calculations based on size save time and reduce errors.</li> <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> You can adjust margins easily and create custom quotations for different project sizes.</li> <li><strong>Presentation:</strong> Choose between a detailed or simplified quotation view to match your customer’s preferences.</li> </ul> <h3>Wrap-Up 🚀</h3> <p>With Odoo’s powerful quotation template features, you can offer your customers a tailored, professional, and clear quotation experience. Whether you're calculating materials for a roofing project or simplifying your sales orders, these tools are designed to make your business run smoother and more efficiently.</p>
